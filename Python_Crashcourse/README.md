# Real World Python Examples
Greetings, and welcome to my collection of Python examples!
Here you will find a collection of Python scripts I have used for completing various tasks during my research.

The purpose of this code is for teaching.
There will certaintly be things that are not done efficiently, with the hope that they are simple to understand (I would rather be inefficient and readable).  
Think of these examples as templates, you are welocme to find better ways (and you should) to complete whatever task you have, but these can give you some reference points. 
As always, I cannot promise these codes will be up-to-date in the future, but I hope they help!

## Matrix Analysis with Pandas:
I use the Pandas package for Python to read in a data file, and plot each element of a matrix as it converges.
The data file used is roughly 100 by 100 (that is a lot of matrix elements to evaluate with excel by hand). 
I plot the diagonal elements, and the off diagoanl elements, to observe their convergence.
