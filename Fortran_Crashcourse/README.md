# Fortran Crash Course
Greetings and Welcome to the Fortran Crash Course!

Inside you will find a living document for teaching Fortran (90). 
The intended audiance includes advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students interested in computational chemistry and related fields.

Little to no previous programming knowledge is expected from users.
Please do keep in mind however, this is not a general all purpose programming introduction.
These lessons cover basic computational methods found in these disciplines and cannot replace a generic introduction to programming. 

We strive to make these materials as accurate as possible, however they are provided 'as is' and should be applied with this in mind. 
Feel free to contact us if there are any potential mistakes that can be corrected.

## Material Usage:
All materials made available here were developed with the intention of helping students entering computaional chemistry research.
We are generting these materials as a scholarly pursuit, not for hire, and have decided to make them freely available. 
We hope that the material can be useful to anyone motivated to enter conputational science, looking for somewhere to begin self-study. 

For these reasons we have decided to place the content under (c) Shane Flynn and contributers, with the following understanding:
