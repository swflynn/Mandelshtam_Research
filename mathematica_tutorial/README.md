# The Notebook:
Alan Robledo (resident Mathematica Guru), an undergraduate student working in the Furche Group at UCI developed an extremly useful tutorial for using Mathematica.
This notebook covers everything from formatting and writing in the notebook, to basic mathematics, plotting, and numerical methods. 
This notebook was made with Chem132A in mind, and should be your first resource for learning the basics of Mathematica!

The Mathematica software uses a file type called a notebook (nb). 
We will post these files as zip files (name.zip) which can be downloaded from Github.

To use the tutorial:

1. Install Mathematica on your computer!

2. Download the name.zip file to your computer.

3. Open the file with Mathematica and you will be able to work through the tutorial!
